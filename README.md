This course presents an object-oriented approach to software development used in large-scale programming projects. A software engineering methodology, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), will be used for object, dynamic, and functional modeling. Students learn how to implement a system using an appropriate object oriented programming language. Programming topics include: Classes and data abstraction, operator overloading, inheritance, virtual functions and polymorphisms, templates, exception handling, and class libraries including GUI applications.
