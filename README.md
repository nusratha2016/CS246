# CS246

This course introduces the different ways that data is organized and stored in computer memory and the relevant procedures used in the manipulation of that data. The idea of abstract data types (ADTs) is first introduced, and then reinforced through the characterization of fundamental data structures in the discipline - stacks, queues, and trees. Other topics are recursive algorithms, dynamic storage, and complexity. Algorithms for searching and sorting are also implemented.
